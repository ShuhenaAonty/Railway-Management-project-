Till June 2, 1982, the management and development of railway was vested with a Railway Board, comprising of a Chairman and four members. But, for administrative convenience and operational reason the Railway Board was abolished with effect from June 3, 1982 and the function of the Railway Board was vested with the Railway Division of the Ministry of Communications with the Secretary of the Division working as the Director General of Bangladesh Railway. For the same purpose the Railway bifurcated into two zones, East & West, under the administrative control of two general managers, who are accountable to the Director General of Bangladesh Railway. Subsequently on August 12, 1995 the day to day operation of the Railway was separated from the Ministry and entrusted with director general drawn from the Railway professionals. For policy guidance, a 9(nine) member Bangladesh Railway

authority (BRA) was formed with the Minster Ministory of Communications as its Chairman. The Director General is assisted by Additional Director General and Joint Director General to perform all administrative and policy making jobs.
